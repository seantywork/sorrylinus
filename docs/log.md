- switched from csv parser to sqlite3 database

as a result, the project brought in two more denpendencies (sqlite3, libsqlite3-dev),

the reason for switching is that as I gave more thoughts about what information should be handled and managed forward,

the need for more tables became apparant and I do not want multiple .csv files rolling around.

- run script added and tested 

run script handles the AP mode installation process, server build(if not existing already), and initiation of the server.

the script has been tested (05-05-2023) on a raspberrypi machine with following specifications
